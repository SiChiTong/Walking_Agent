# Walking_Agent
In this repository, the source code of the walking agent is given. The code originally has been developed to test the Gazebo RoboCup plugin by comparing walking behavior in Gazebo with Simspark simulator. The same walking controller has been used for walking behavior of the FCPortugal team, and had also been tested in on a real NAO robot.
